- [ ] Need to adjust so we are using numbers to reference flags within the flag register

- [ ] Adjust flag register to be low bytes and accumulator high bytes

- [ ] Reg is called PSW (Program Status Word)

- [ ] Keep stack pointer in another seperate 16 bit space

- [ ] Some sort of function for updating and retrieving the flag reg so we can interface it in the same way
